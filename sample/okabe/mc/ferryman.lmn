NAME
	Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage (nondeterministic LMNtal version)

SYNOPSIS
	A wolf, a goat and a cabbage are on the left side of the river.
	A ferryman, also on the left side, can carry them to the other side
	with his ferry. 
	However, if the wolf and the goat are on the same side without the ferryman,
	the goat will be eaten by the wolf.
	Also, the goat and the cabbage are, too.
	Now, can you move all but the ferryman to the right side of the river?
